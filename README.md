# Deferred Decision Trajectory Optimization via Sequential Convex Programming

## `ex1`
 - double integrator with (nonlinear) drag
 - ddto subproblem
 - constraints only at node points
 - trajectory to each of targets independently parameterized
 - identical portion of the trajectories specified by index `Kstr` of normalized time `tau` 

## `ex2`
 - double integrator with (nonlinear) drag
 - ddto subproblem
 - continuous-time satisfaction of constraints (except for identicality)
 - trajectory to each of targets independently parameterized
 - identical portion of the trajectories specified by index `Kstr` of normalized time `tau`
