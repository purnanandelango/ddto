# Deferred Decision Trajectory Optimization

## `ddto-qcvx`
 - discrete-time 2D double integrator
 - convex path constraints: speed upper bound, thrust upper bound

## `ddto-scp`
 - continuous-time 3D quadrotor with drag
 - nonconvex path constraints: obstacle avoidance, speed upper bound, thrust upper and lower bound
